Airlines Reservation System deals with the various activities related to the flights.

It is a web-based flight booking agency that is used to conduct flight bookings.

Earlier all activities were done manually, which was very time-consuming and costly. But the Airlines Reservation System simplifies the booking process and is helpful for both travel agencies and travelers.

This project is designed in a way that includes faster system accuracy, and reliability, and makes it more informative.
